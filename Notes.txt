# Using Gamma and Claude for presentation generation

RecycleVision

I want to work on a visual AI classification model which can detect E-WASTE products such as smartphones, televisions, circuit borads, and small household appliances.

Ask claude to explaing the problem and cost of E-Waste.

Ask for it to give a pitch deck which can be the input of the gamma AI which can generate a presentation. This can help escalate my project quickly.
